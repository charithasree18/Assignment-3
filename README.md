## DEscription

This repository includes Python scripts that demonstrate the use of mathematical functions and user input handling.

ðŸ§® Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
Description:
This script defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop. The function is then called with a user-input number, and the result is displayed.

Key Concepts:
Functions

Loops

User input

âž— Task 2: Mathematical Operations Using the math Module
Description:
This script prompts the user to input a number and then uses Pythonâ€™s math module to calculate and display:

The square root of the number

The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number

The sine of the number (in radians)

Key Concepts:
math module functions (sqrt, log, sin)

User input handling
